# static-live-stream

Hello! This is a web application that is deployed on Heroku. It will allow the user to select from a static feed, in which I have a video teaching one about Polar Bears(it was the first video that popped up on my YouTube feed) or a live feed which will stream the webcam in my home.

Please visit <a href="https://static-live-stream.herokuapp.com/">here</a> to access the web app.

To create this website, the following were used:
<ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Ananconda</li>
	<li>Flask Framework</li>
	<li>GCP: OAuth</li>
	<li>Ngrok</li>
	<li>Heroku</li>
</ul>

The most helpful resource of all, however, was the help of my classmates in CNT4713. I had zero knowledge of how to do this and without their help, I would have failed.
